### Learning Objectives

1. RSA
RSA is an encryption and decryption algorithm used for security developed by __**Rivesht Shamir Adleman**__ <br>
It uses public keys to encrypt any message and a private key is used to decrypt
thee messages.
2. How does HTTPS provide security?
3. Prime Factorization
4. Why RSA?
